NOTE 
- Mac won't currently build from the PC as Xamarin.iOS is currently in the lab under development.
- To make it build on the Mac you will need to substitute the 'real PCLs' with versions built using Xamarin.iOS on the Mac

The steps to get this Mac UI working are:

1. Add a reference to your Core PCL project
2. Create a Setup.cs file
3. Modify AppDelegate.cs to create the new Setup and to call the IMvxAppStart
4. Add a Views folder and a view/viewcontroller pair - cs - change the NSViewController inheritance to MvxViewController, NSView to MvView
5. Edit the ViewDidLoad in the cs to add a bound control - e.g:

        public override void ViewDidLoad()
        {
           tbd
        }

Where this requires using's of:

    using YourNameSpace.Core.ViewModels;
    using Cirrious.MvvmCross.Binding.BindingContext;
    using Cirrious.MvvmCross.Mac.Views;
